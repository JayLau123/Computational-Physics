Widely used methods of computational physics including some numerical computations in classic and quantum mechanics.

### Introduction

Computational physics is an interdisciplinary field that combines physics, mathematics, and computer science to study and solve complex physical problems. It involves the development and use of numerical algorithms and computational tools to simulate, analyze, optimize, and predict the behavior of physical systems, ranging from subatomic particles to large-scale structures in the universe.

Computational physics has become an essential component of modern scientific research, as it allows scientists to investigate phenomena that might be too difficult, expensive, or dangerous to study through experiments. Some key areas in which computational physics is applied include:

1. Statistical physics: Simulating the behavior of systems with many interacting particles, such as in the study of phase transitions, critical phenomena, and soft matter.

2. Quantum mechanics: Solving the Schr√∂dinger equation for multi-particle systems, studying quantum field theories, and simulating quantum computing.

3. Condensed matter physics: Investigating the electronic, magnetic, and mechanical properties of materials, such as semiconductors, superconductors, and nanostructures.


4. Fluid dynamics: Simulating the behavior of fluids, such as air and water, which can help in understanding weather patterns, designing more efficient transportation systems, and predicting natural disasters.

5. Particle physics: Simulating high-energy particle collisions to understand the fundamental forces and particles in the universe.

6. Biophysics: Modeling and simulating moleculaes and biological systems, such as protein folding, cellular dynamics, and neural networks.

Computational physics has seen significant advancements in recent years, driven by improvements in computer hardware, software, and numerical algorithms. High-performance computing, parallel processing, machine learning, and quantum computing have further enhanced the capabilities of computational physics, allowing researchers to tackle more complex problems and obtain more accurate results with high probability.
